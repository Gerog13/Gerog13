### Hey there :wave: , I'm Geronimo Garcia

I'm a 21 years old ***Frontend Developer*** from Argentina.
I started my way on programming by taking a course from Egg Tech where I learned the basics of programming and algorithms using Java as the principal language, MySQL to learn the principles of databases, HTML5 CSS and JavaScript to learn the basics of Frontend and finally I learned how to use  Spring Boot, Jpa and Thymeleaf. 
While taking that course I started to learn everything related to Frontend. I started taking courses on different platforms  such as Youtube, Udemy and searching information and reading documentation on Google about the basics: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. After that, I started to learn React Js as JavaScript library and Tailwind Css and Bootstrap as CSS frameworks. Finally, I started to learn how to use NodeJs, Express and MongoDB in order to be able to develop Fullstack Apps.
